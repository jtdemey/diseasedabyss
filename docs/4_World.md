## Factions

### The Migribellus
> "Let the deep resonance of their horns be a clear signal to either flee or prepare for a bloodthirsty viciousness unparalleled by mankind. Each towered over my crew, and took considerable numbers to overcome just one. . ." -*Sevitte Solcrist, Explorer & Trader*

There is much not known about the Migribellus' culture, but war is undoubtably one of its cornerstones. Attempts to converse peacefully or engage in diplomacy are consistently met with violence, even in times of dire urgency. Descending from orcish tribes of the past, they seem to travel with the fish they harvest, often stealing or sinking vessels that happen upon their wake. Although many land settlements have fallen to the Migribellus throughout the past, the people seem apt to stay afloat, never settling on the land they conquer through sheer might.

### The Muscapista
- Faction of winged humans for maps and messages, intellectually advanced with their collective knowledge, engaged in commerce

### Federfis
- Powerful merchants who have consolidated the south pole, unaggressive and diplomatic, with slapdash mercenary armed forces

### The Fenscavus
- Spartan-like dwarves, conservative, military-minded people who are extremely defensive of their sparse territories, frequently wage war with military prowess
