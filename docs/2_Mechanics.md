## Campaign Events <a name="campaignevents"></a>
*Campaign Events* (CEs) are the central mechanic that propels the random narrative of DA. The DM rolls for a Campaign Event to initiate each session, and furthermore during the session at their own discretion. CEs are classified by their *nature* and *degree*, which can be constrained or dictated by the DM at their whim.

### Campaign Event Natures
1. **Chaotic**: This is the default nature of a CE. It entails randomly choosing from any of the other natures through a die roll.
2. **Natural**: A natural process of Vera causes an environmental effect, such as a whirlpool forming or a storm approaching.
3. **Encounter**: The intersection of two or more seacraft, not necessarily hostile.
4. **Altercation**: The intersection of two or more hostile seacraft, or alternatively a threat from a creature below.
5. **Land Ho!**: The party encounters something large enough upon Vera's surface to constitute traversable land, such as a large glacier, a drifting remnant of a civilization, or rarely a patch of natural land.
6. **Summoning the Ancients**: It is common for the shifting of Vera's plates to dislodge pieces of ancient civilizations, some contents of which may float to the surface. Sometimes these contents are large enough to be traversed, but most are merely relics indicating that treasures of past generations are below.
7. **Region Traversal**: The seas of Vera are not homogenous. The environment varies from hot, humid seas of water speckled with regular monsoons, to arctic sheets of loose ice shards accompanied by frigid winds. Some seas are poisonous or acidic, while others are comprised of liquids bestowed with magical effects. This event marks moving from one environment to another, which may or may not be undoable.

### Campaign Event Degrees
To further configure the severity of a CE's effects on the party, they are further classified by the *degree* to which they pose a threat.

1. **Mundane**: This degree does not threaten the life or safety of the PCs (barring truly extraordinary circumstances) and typically does not bear too many notable repurcussions.
2. **Mild**: CEs of this degree are more notable than mundane, but do not constitute any level of real urgency, and can often be overlooked or avoided. Mild CEs do not necessarily entail danger, but the rash actions of a PC in response to a mild CE could potentially yield danger.
3. **Moderate**: This degree constitutes events that force the players to respond or face negative or unforeseen consequences, but not typically death.
4. **Severe**: Events that are easily life-threatening fall into this degree.

## Acquiring a Ship <a name="acquiringaship"></a>
Each ship has a distinct *class*, *size*, and *quality*. A ship's *class* refers to its intended function, its *size* is a measurement of width by length in meters, and its *quality* refers to a combination of the structural application of well-designed materials as well as the craftsmanship of the ship's builders. Each *class* of ship can be constructed with one or more levels of *quality*.

### Ship Classes
1. **Fishing vessels**

    A. **Trawlers**
    These ships are designed to deploy trawls at various depths in hopes of catching fish.

2. **Utility vessels**

    A. **Dredgers**

### Ship Qualities

1. **Salvaged**
Although land is sparse in Vera, materials to make floating vessels can often be found strewn across the surface, as remnants and refuse from civilizations and other aquatic life drift upwards. Salvaged seacraft can indeed be fashioned from these remnants, but the process is arduous and difficult, requiring an adept shipbuilder to be effective. 

2. **Shoddy**
Shoddy vessels are functional, and with continued maintenance can fare most seas, but they stand frail against the more tumultuous environments and a well-placed cannon shot can easily compromise their hulls.

3. **Standard**
Standard vessels are defined by having an intact and unrotted hull and being able to operate with typical maintenance.

4. **Exceptional**
Exceptional vessels are of remarkable quality, built from finer materials and with well-designed frames that can withstand the harsh turmoils of the sea.

5. **Masterwork**
Made from the finest refined alloys, the rarest driftwoods, and the finest canvases, masterwork vessels are rare and valuable.
